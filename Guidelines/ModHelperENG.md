### Using a helper mod:
[RU version](/Guidelines/ModHelperRu.md)

### Use of a helper mod is available from version 2.7

Using helper mod allows you to add items stash if it contains items added by mods, add items added by mods, edit status of quests and levels of merchants added by mods.

### How it works:
After loading server and all mods, helper mod exports necessary data from server database to local files for use in profile editor.

### How to use:
1. Install server and all necessary mods. Start server, launcher, and create profile. Log into game using created profile. If a profile has already been created, and you logged into game with it previously, you can skip this step.
2. Close game, launcher and server.
3. Launch profile editor, specify the server folder, and select your profile. If you have already configured a profile editor, you can skip this step.
4. Go to "Helper mod" section ("Settings" - "Helper mod"). Click "Install". Helper mod will be installed on server, using a helper mod will be automatically enabled. Close settings. After installing mod, when loading the profile, you will get "Could not find DB file generated by the helper mod..." error, close profile editor.
5. Start server, and wait for green message "[[SPT-AKI Profile Editor] Helper Mod] : DB successfully exported".
6. Shut down server and start profile editor.
